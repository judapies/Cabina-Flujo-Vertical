We want to execute the main method in the class MyClass in the package MyPackage when we run the JAR file. 
We first create a text file named Manifest.txt with the following contents: 

Main-Class: MyPackage.MyClass



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Warning : The text file must end with a new line or carriage return. The last line will not be parsed properly if it does not end with a new line or carriage return. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We then create a JAR file named MyJar.jar by entering the following command: 
jar cfm MyJar.jar Manifest.txt MyPackage/*.class

This creates the JAR file with a manifest with the following contents: 
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Created-By: 1.6.0 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)
Main-Class: MyPackage.MyClass

When you run the JAR file with the following command, the main method of MyClass executes: 
java -jar MyJar.jar
